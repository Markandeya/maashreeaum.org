                            <p>The celebration of Guru Purnima this month is a moment to offer our deepest respect and
                                reverence to SHREE GURU.</p>

                            <p>Through Guru Pada Pujan and Yajna, the sadhaks discipline themselves to accept and follow
                                the Atma Path and Guru Path with unwavering devotion. This time, Shree Guru bestowed the
                                prasadam of Atma Pranaam—an offering of reverence to the Inner Self.</p>

                            <p>Furthermore, Shree Guru revealed that while this place and this yajna may seem to exist
                                on this earthly land, in truth they do not… the whole realm had transcended into the
                                Guru Gharana.</p>

                            <p>Shree Guru asked the sadhaks about their understanding of their Gotra, their genus

                                from SHREE GURU MAASHREE.</p>

                            <p>The monsoon sweeped across this land with the grandeur of a giant. Amidst this lush
                                embrace of nature unfolded the sacred celebration of Ganesh Chaturthi. With devotion and
                                love, the sadhaks crafted idols of Lord Ganesha following the divine dictum of Shree
                                Guru, each representing their personal vision of the divine. They offered bhoga,
                                flowers, and heartfelt worship, accompanied by the chanting of mantras and deep
                                meditation.</p>

                            <p>Shree Guru imparted a sacred wisdom of Shree Ganesha embodying the purest essence, deeply
                                connected to the Bhoomi Tatwa (element of earth). For this reason, He is revered as
                                "Gana" (for all) and "Ish" (God). Ganesha is honored as "Pratham Pujya," the first deity
                                to be worshipped before any other, signifying that the mind must first be cleansed and
                                purified to embark upon the spiritual journey. The offering of durva or trina symbolizes
                                a nature filled with gratitude, humility and contentment.</p>

                            <p>When purity and gratitude come together, the mind becomes ready to walk the spiritual
                                path.</p>

                            <p>As in every year, the sacred Narayan Yajna was performed on the holy land of Badrinath.
                                This year, the journey to Badrinath was filled with uncertainty due to natural disaster
                                and landslides along the way. In that unpredictable journey, Shree Guru continued
                                guiding and motivating the sadhaks to prepare their minds for any situation that might
                                arise. Shree Guru reminded them that a sadhak's mind must be as resilient as a
                                soldier's—ready for all circumstances and filled with acceptance. During that time,
                                Shree Guru had to stay mostly in Rishikesh, where She led uplifting spiritual sessions
                                twice daily. Observing her the sadhaks discovered how to remain content and steady, even
                                amidst the uncertainties of life.</p>

                                celebrations began with Mahalaya on the no-moon day, when, before dawn, the sadhaks
                                offered tarpan in Dev Dhara—the stream encircling the ashram—on the final day of Pitru
                                Paksha. This was followed by the Purnahuti Yajna on Pratipada, the first day of
                                Navratri, where the sadhaks wholeheartedly dedicated themselves to their Ishta, their
                                Shree Guru.</p>
