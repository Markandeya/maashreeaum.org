                                the Guru</h5>

                            <p>Journeying through the mountains in the month of May with Maashree transforms a simple
                                trip into a profound spiritual pilgrimage. Each day blends physical ascent with inner
                                growth, offering deeper insights into life and spirituality. At Rudraprayag, the serene
                                confluence of the Alaknanda and Mandakini rivers mirrors the merging of external and
                                internal silence, while the climb itself symbolizes the spiritual struggle for
                                self-awareness. During our stay, Maa made a poignant remark: "You are the stars, but
                                you still like to be with family, attachments, and in bondage." Her words highlighted
                                our limited progress in spiritual practice, or sadhana.</p>

                            <p>On Akshaya Tritiya, a significant day of auspicious beginnings, after Maa's morning
                                online session, we embarked on the journey to Bhavisya Badri. This sacred site,
                                surrounded by majestic peaks, became a place of profound transformation. Maashree
                                shared a mystical past encounter and performed a quiet ritual inside the existing
                                temple that deepened our connection to the divine. The day was filled with reflections
                                on life's impermanence and the essential role of devotion (bhakti) in spiritual
                                practice.</p>

                            <p>As we descended from the mountains back to the plains, the majestic silence began to
                                fade, replaced by the familiar sounds of everyday life. Yet, the spiritual lessons
                                remained vivid. The journey back symbolized a return to the world with renewed purpose,
                                clarity, and a deeper connection to the divine.</p>

                            <p>In the month of JUNE, the Aashram surroundings on Sahyadri's are graced with a golden
                                appearance due to the abundance of sunlight all over... In this raised climatic
                                condition, the sadhana (spiritual practices) as guided by Shree Guru Maashree can also
                                be felt intensely... This entire month remains ardently focused only on such practices.
                                When the common mind does not appreciate the weather around due to the scorching heat,
                                Shree Guru Maashree makes us experience the science behind and guides us the way to
                                calm our body and mind.</p>

                            <p>In mid-June, our revered Shree Guru Maashree came to Kolkata. During that time, some of
                                the devotees had the opportunity for close interaction with Guru. On June 23rd, there
                                was a session at Jyotirmayi Hall, where a question-and-answer session was held,
                                focusing on how to follow a spiritual path in daily life while living in the world. Our
                                Guru discussed in detail how we can maintain a good and healthy life amidst our daily
                                tasks, studies, and household responsibilities, and how to make it possible.
                                Additionally, on International Yoga Day, various schools and corporate houses were
                                guided by Uttarann to practice bhavasana, pranayama, and meditation.</p>

                            <h5 class="mb-3 text-center text-muted">Guru Purnima Celebrations</h5>

                            <p>This year's Guru Purnima at the Ashram was a deeply spiritual and memorable event,
                                filled with profound experiences and heartfelt devotion. The day was not just a
                                celebration of the Guru but an homage to the very essence of 'Guru,' honoring all those
                                who embody this sacred role. The Yagna, followed by Jal Arpan, was a powerful ritual
                                that made participants feel as if they were surrounded by countless suns, their spirits
                                illuminated by the grace of Shree Guru Maashree. The event carried a unique
                                significance, as Shree Guru was seen not only as the revered 'worshipped' but also as
                                an 'Acharya,' guiding the participants through the intricate rituals of the Yagna. This
                                guidance made them worthy of conducting the Guru Purnima Yagna, an honor that felt
                                impossible without Sri Guru's presence.</p>

                            <p>Adding to the day's fulfillment was the opportunity to provide Bhog to school children,
                                whose innocent smiles mirrored the joy in MAA's sparkling eyes as She interacted with
                                them. Students and parents were also offered seasonal essentials like umbrella. All of
                                them, blessed with Shree Guru Maashree's graces, sung GURU AUM together with delighted
                                hearts. Receiving the Rudraksha from MAA was a cherished moment that deepened the
                                spiritual connection for the sadhaks. The entire celebration left everyone with a
                                profound sense of gratitude, serenity, and inner fulfillment. These moments, though
                                fleeting, will continue to inspire and remind all the importance of unwavering
                                commitment and surrender to MAA.</p>
