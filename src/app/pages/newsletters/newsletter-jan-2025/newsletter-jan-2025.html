                            <p>In June, a few sadhaks of Uttaran were bestowed with the grace to participate in a
                                meditation retreat in Tawang from 6th–14th June 2025.</p>

                            <p>In Tawang, SHREE GURU took residence in a resort nestled in the valley. On the peak of a
                                nearby hill sits the Tawang Monastery. The next day, the sadhaks visited this monastery
                                along with SHREE GURU.</p>
                            <p>SHREE GURU was answering a calling from this land—a calling that led HER on this journey
                                to Tawang, the source of which remained unrevealed. Upon further enquiry, the hotel
                                manager informed us about the presence of a remote monastery on a hill—a Gompa, meaning
                                cave—where people rarely venture out of fear. It was said to be a place so sacred that
                                people hesitate to visit without preparation and self-purification. The manager
                                explained that visiting this place requires one to observe austerities and restrict the
                                mind, body, and diet for several days beforehand.</p>
                            <p>The very description of the place felt like a revelation of the calling. SHREE GURU was
                                immediately drawn to the Gompa.</p>

                            <p>On the second day of the retreat, SHREE GURU, along with the sadhaks, began a sacred
                                passage to this remote Gompa. Through an untouched rocky trail cutting across an expanse
                                of dense forest, under the guidance of a local guide, SHREE GURU ascended on foot across
                                uncertain terrain to reach the monastery. It was a luminous experience for the sadhaks
                                to witness SHREE GURU walk that path. Observing SHREE GURU climb, one saw a strength
                                that transcended the physical domain. The path was steep, long, and rugged—one that even
                                young sadhaks struggled to tread.</p>

                            <p>Upon reaching the Gompa, SHE found the source of the calling and the reason for HER
                                journey to Tawang—the mystical veils of the Gompa.</p>
                            <p>The sadhaks simply bore witness to the otherworldly presence of SHREE GURU, an outpouring
                                as it unfolded in that moment. The experience at the Gompa was beyond understanding.</p>
                            <p>SHREE GURU was in a state of Nothingness. SHE had found the place SHE was called to. It
                                is said that thousands of Lamas remain in meditation, hidden away in those mountains.
                                Witnessing how a person can break all physical barriers—was it love, or something far
                                beyond perception? How and why SHREE GURU endured such physical pain to make the
                                journey?</p>
                            <p>Some questions have no answers—only experiences.</p>

                            <p>The next day was SHREE JAGANNATH’s Snan Yatra. SHREE GURU delivered a divine discourse
                                from our place of stay in Tawang, surrounded by the hills and the serenity of the
                                valley. SHE imparted knowledge on practicing cleanliness within—of our minds and
                                thoughts—which leads to cleanliness without.

                                The following day marked the journey back to Guwahati through the picturesque green
                                hills of Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
