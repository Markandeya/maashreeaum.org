                            <p>In June, few sadhaks of Uttaran were bestowed with the divine grace to participate in a
                                Meditation retreat in Tawang from 6th-14th June.</p>

                            <p>In Tawang, SHREE GURU took residence in a resort nestled in the valley of Tawang, called
                                Timilo, which means Holy Slope. On the peak of this hill sits the Tawang Monastery.
                                Sadhaks visited this monastery along with SHREE GURU, the next day. SHREE GURU was
                                seeking something, that led HER Divine being to embark on this journey to Tawang. On
                                further enquiry, the hotel manager informed about the presence of a remote Monastery on
                                a hill, where people do not venture without caution. Visiting that place requires one to
                                observe austerities and restrict their mind, body and what they eat for a duration of
                                atleast three days.</p>

                            <p>On the second day of the retreat, SHREE GURU along with the sadhaks embarked on the
                                journey to this remote Monastery through an expanse of dense forest, under the guidance
                                of a local guide. SHREE GURU walked on foot on this uncertain terrain through the dense
                                forest to reach the Monastery - Krompten Gonpa. It was a Divine experience for the
                                sadhaks to witness SHREE GURU walk on That Path 🙏🏻. On reaching the Monastery, SHE
                                found what SHE was looking for and the reason for HER journey to Tawang. The sadhaks
                                were blessed to witness the Divine play that unfolded in that moment 🙏🏻.</p>

                            <p>The experience at the Gompa was beyond understanding.</p>
                            <p>SHREE GURU was in a state of Nothingness. SHE had found the place she was called to…It is
                                said that thousands of Lamas remain in meditation, hidden away in those
                                mountains.Witnessing how a person can break all physical barriers through divine love.
                                How much physical pain SHREE GURU endured on that journey.</p>

                            <p>The next day was SHREE JAGANNATH's Snan Yatra. SHREE GURU delivered a divine discourse
                                from Timilo, surrounded by the hills and serenity of the valley. SHE talked about
                                cleanliness from within, i.e our minds and thoughts, that leads to cleanliness
                                without.The next day marked the journey back to Guwahati through the picturesque green
                                hills of Arunachal Pradesh.</p>
